# hello-world
Project for following the github 1st guide
I want to be a senior web developper in a year. For that, I'll put my hand to any tool that would help me get there. I won't be easy, but it'll be done with all the help from experienced developper that are willing to share their knowledge. :-)
Thanks in advance!!!
